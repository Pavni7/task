**Task Description: User Login Page Implementation
Overview**
We have successfully implemented the user login functionality as part of our note-taking application built with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. This section describes the steps and considerations involved in adding the login feature.

**Backend (FastAPI)
User Authentication:**

JWT Tokens: We have implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client.
Login Endpoint: An endpoint has been created to handle user login requests. The endpoint verifies user credentials and issues a JWT token if the credentials are valid.
Implementation Details:

**Endpoint: POST /auth/login**

Request Body: The endpoint expects a JSON object with username and password.
Response: On successful authentication, the server responds with a JWT token.
Error Handling: Appropriate error messages are returned for invalid credentials or missing fields.
JWT Token Generation: We use the pyjwt library to generate and decode JWT tokens. The token includes user-specific information and has an expiration time for security.

Frontend (React)
User Interface:

**Login Form:** A simple login form has been designed using React. The form collects the username and password from the user.
API Integration: The form data is sent to the backend login endpoint using axios.
Implementation Details:

**Login Component:** Created a React component for the login page.

Form Handling: Used React state to manage form inputs and handle form submission.
API Call: On form submission, an API call is made to the backend login endpoint.
Token Management: On successful login, the JWT token received from the backend is stored in local storage for maintaining user sessions.
Route Protection: Implemented route protection to ensure only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application. Routes requiring authentication check for the presence of a valid JWT token in local storage.

**Styling:**

**CSS:** Basic CSS has been applied to style the login form, ensuring it is user-friendly and visually appealing.
How to Run the Application
Backend:

Install Dependencies:

 
**pip install fastapi uvicorn pymongo motor pyjwt**
Start the FastAPI Server:


**uvicorn main:app --reload**
Frontend:

Install Dependencies:

 
**npm install**
Start the React Application:

 
**npm start**
Conclusion
The user login functionality is a crucial part of our application, ensuring secure access to user-specific data. By integrating JWT authentication in the backend and implementing a user-friendly login interface in the frontend, we have established a solid foundation for user authentication and session management in our note-taking application.
